= Streama

**ALPHA**

Streama is a simple Ruby activity stream gem for use with the Mongoid ODM framework.

== Install

  $ gem install streama
  
== Usage

=== Define Activities

Create an Activity model and define the activities and the fields you would like to cache within the activity.

An activity consists of an actor, a verb, an object, and a target. 

  class Activity
    include Streama::Activity
  
    activity :new_enquiry do
      actor :user, :cache => [:full_name]
      object :enquiry, :cache => [:subject, :comment]
      target :listing, :cache => [:title]
      receiver :user, :cache => []
    end
  
  end

The activity verb is implied from the activity name, in the above example the verb is :new_enquiry

The object may be the entity performing the activity, or the entity on which the activity was performed.
e.g John(actor) shared a video(object)

The target is the object that the verb is enacted on.
e.g. Geraldine(actor) posted a photo(object) to her album(target)

This is based on the Activity Streams 1.0 specification (http://activitystrea.ms)

=== Setup Actors

Include the Actor module in a class and override the default followers method.

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Streama::Actor

		field :full_name, :type => String

    def followers
    	User.excludes(:id => self.id).all
    end
  end

=== Setup Indexes

Create the indexes for the Activities collection. You can do so by calling the create_indexes method.

  Activity.create_indexes

=== Publishing Activity

In your controller or background worker:

  current_user.publish_activity(:new_enquiry, :object => @enquiry, :target => @listing)

This will publish the activity to the mongoid objects returned by the #followers method in the Actor.

To send your activity to different receievers, pass in an additional :receivers parameter.

  current_user.publish_activity(:new_enquiry, :object => @enquiry, :target => @listing, :receivers => :friends) # calls friends method
  current_user.publish_activity(:new_enquiry, :object => @enquiry, :target => @listing, :receivers => current_user.find(:all, :conditions => {:group_id => mygroup}))

To send your activity to a single receiver, pass in an additional :receiver parameter. This can be used to self-publish the actor's activity.

  current_user.publish_activity(:new_enquiry, :object => @enquiry, :target => @listing, :receiver => current_user)

== Retrieving Activity

To retrieve all activity for an actor
  
  current_user.activity_stream
  
To retrieve and filter to a particular activity type

  current_user.activity_stream(:type => :activity_verb)

If you need to return the instance of an :actor, :object or :target from an activity call the Activity#load_instance method

  activity.load_instance(:actor)
  
You can also refresh the cached activity data by calling the Activity#refresh_data method
  
  activity.refresh_data
  
== Compatibility

Streama is developed against Ruby 1.9.2 and Mongoid 2

== TODO

* Write more documentation, YARD
* Write more tests
* Benchmarks
